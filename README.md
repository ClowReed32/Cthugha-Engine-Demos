Cthugha_engine is a small engine implemented in C++ and based on 
"Game Coding Complete" by Mike McShaffry and David Graham.

Implemented techniques:

- Tiled deferred shading and tiled forward rendering for translucent objects.

- Physically based rendering. Cook-Torrance Model.

- Voxel cone tracing global illumination (two bounces). *Interactive Indirect Illumination Using Voxel Cone Tracing. 
  Cyril Crassin, Fabrice Neyret, Miguel Sainz, Simon Green, Elmar Eisemann  (2011)*.

- Signed Distance Field Soft Shadows. *Dynamic occlusion with signed distance field. Epic Games. Siggraph 2015*.

- Volumetric Scattering. *Volumetric Fog: Unified compute shader based solution to atmospheric scattering. Ubisoft Montreal. Siggraph 2014*. 

- Temporal Screen Space Ambient Occlusion.
